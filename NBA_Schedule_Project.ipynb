        "\n",
        "(a) all the dates when team i played home; (b) for each team j, the number of times team i played against team j at home; (c) for each team j, the number of times team i played against team j away (i.e., at j's home).\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Compute a feasible schedule that satisfy the following additional constraint: no team should play two consecutive away matches, one on the east coast (i.e. away against Celtics, Knicks, Wizards) and the other on the west coast (i.e., away against Warriors, Lakers, Clippers); or conclude that no such schedule exists.\n",

For instance, using Google Maps, you could compute and store the locations of all arenas, compute a feasible schedule that minimizes the maximum distance traveled by a team, and compare this value with the one of the current schedule to show the improvement.
